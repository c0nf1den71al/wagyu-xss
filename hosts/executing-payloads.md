# Executing Payloads

Once a compromised host appears within the hosts table, click on the row to open a new terminal tab.

To execute a payload use the command prompt within Wagyu. The following command can be used:

```shell
execute <payload_name>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To quickly complete the payload name, you can drag and drop the payload from the table into the command prompt.
{% endhint %}
