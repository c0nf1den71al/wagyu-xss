# Executing Payloads

To execute a payload use the command prompt within Wagyu. The following command can be used:

```shell
execute <payload_name> <host_id>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To quickly complete the payload name and host id, you can drag and drop the items from the corresponding tables into the command prompt.
{% endhint %}
