# Modifying Existing Payloads

{% hint style="danger" %}
Any changes made to existing payloads cannot be undone. Please ensure you backup your payloads
{% endhint %}

There are two ways to edit an existing payload within the Wagyu client. You can click the "**Payload Editor**" button located at the top right of the application. Alternatively, you can click the pencil icon in the "**Actions**" column of the payload you wish to edit from the "**Payloads**" tab.

From here you will be able to change the following for each payload:

* **Name** - The name of the payload (this must be unique)
* **Description** - A description for the payload
* **Browser Compatibility** - Which browsers the payload is able to successfully execute in
* **Type** - The type of payload. [Learn more](./#payload-types)
* **Risk** - The risk of executing the payload. [Learn more](./#payload-risk)
* **Payload** - The JavaScript code to be executed
* **Notes** - Any notes for the payload

Once you have changed the required details, you can click the "**Update**" button which will push the changes to the server.
