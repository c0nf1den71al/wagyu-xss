  How to connect and login to the team server using the Wagyu client
  application.
---

# Connecting

After starting the Wagyu client application you can authenticate into the team server by using the address of the server followed by the default port `3000` (unless changed).

You can login to the default admin user by using `wagyu` as both the username and password.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is strongly recommended that the default password is changed for the admin user after the first login. This can be done within the settings of the client application.
{% endhint %}
